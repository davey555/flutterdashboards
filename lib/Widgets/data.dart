14. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
I don't do a lot of online multiplayer, so I think the big impact of this game was a little lost on me, but I did like the single-player campaign a lot. That first level in the sinking ship was pretty killer.


15. Final Fantasy VII
Haven't played it.


16. Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
How much do I love this game? I have a boxing poster of Little Mac versus Soda Popinski that I bought at the I Am 8-Bit art show hanging in my living room. But I never beat Mike Tyson, sadly. I'll take on King Hippo anytime though, even right now. Let's do this!


17. Chrono Trigger
Haven't played it.


18. Resident Evil 4
Haven't played it.


19. Metal Gear Solid
Haven't played it.


20. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
I played the 3DS version of this one. The dungeons are excellent, but I could do without some of the between dungeon busy work.

21. Super Metroid
I finally played this a year ago. I think it hurt it a little bit that I'd already played the GBA Metroid games, but I still thought it was very good. So many secrets and hidden googaws. Great ending!


22. Contra
Haven't played it. (specifically the NES version - I have played the arcade version)''';
